# üìö Master Spring Boot with JSP Projects

Welcome to the **Master Spring Boot & JSP Project** where I showcase my learning and experiments with **Spring Boot** integrated with **JSP pages**. This repository is dedicated to documenting various projects demonstrating how to build, deploy, and understand Spring Boot applications that utilize JSP as the view technology.

Each subproject in this repository represents a **unique learning experience**. As I continue to grow and explore different concepts within **Spring Boot** and **JSP**, I will be adding more projects along with their corresponding documentation.

## üìù Project Structure and How This Repository Is Organized üöÄ

This master repository will contain:

- **`README.md`**: This main readme file, which will provide an overview of all the projects, the learning journey, and detailed links to each individual project's documentation.
- **`Project Specific Readme files`**: Each of these projects specific README files will explain the project details, learning outcomes, and setup instructions
- **`Individual Project Folders`**: Each folder represents a different Spring Boot + JSP sample project. It will contain all the `Project Code` related to the specific project.
